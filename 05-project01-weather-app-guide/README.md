# Project 1 - Weather App

Weather app is a simple project which touches on a few fundamentals that we have developed so far in the course and enforce the learnings further.

## Guide

**Pre-Requisite Skills:**
-	Understanding of Controllers
-	Understanding of express fundamentals 
-	Understanding Templating 

**Goals of the Project:**
-	Learning how to manage secrets
-	Learning to integrate third party services into the application 
-	Practicing and re-enforcing core API fundamentals 
-	Getting a grasp over templating 

**Required 3rd Party Integrations:**
-	OpenCage API (sign up for API Key here https://opencagedata.com/)
-	OpenMeteo API

> express, ejs, dotenv, axios, nodemon
> folder config, public, routes, controllers, views
> require express, path, dotenv, axios. mw json, urlencoded, view engine --ejs, static --public, cors

## Specifications of the Project: 

1. /(root route):

Render a search page where users can search for a location.

> search results

This page can be rendered with an EJS template which takes a single query and forwards it to the forecast route, passing on the input value into it as the query string.

2. /forecast?q=query (forecast):

Render the results for the specific location

> results of the searching

The page must have 3 sections: 
-	Location Block (contains information about the location) 
-	Current Time Block (contains weather data for the current time) 
-	Hourly Block (gives weather information by the hour) 

To achieve this, we need to do the following. 

-	Create a controller which obtains the forecast information for the requested location.
-	Extract the location from the query string.
-	One small caveat we run into is the fact that OpenMeteo api just takes the longitude and latitude, but unfortunately for us we donâ€™t have something to geocode (converting location name to coordinates). To fix this we bring in the OpenCage API. 
-	Use the OpenCage API to geocode the location which was passed on and extract the coordinates.
-	Using these coordinates make further requests to the Open Meteo API and check the parameters for hourly and current time weather. 
-	Create a template with corresponding cards and render the data onto those pages by passing the retrieved information in parameters to the render method.
