## Semantic Versioning

> SemVer, short for Semantic Versioning, is a versioning scheme that uses three numbers (major.minor.patch) to convey information about software changes. The idea is that increments in each number have specific meanings, helping users understand the impact of updates.

In Semantic Versioning (SemVer), SemVer follows the following standard:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **Major version:** Increased for backward-incompatible changes.
- **Minor version:** Added for backward-compatible new features.
- **Patch version:** Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes or security fixes.

It provides a clear way to communicate the nature of changes in software versions.

> Ex; v15.1.3 => 15 is Major version, 1 is Minor version, 3 is Patch version.

## The Open API Specification

> The OpenAPI Specification, often abbreviated as OAS, is a standard for describing RESTful APIs. It allows developers to define the structure of an API, including endpoints, request/response formats, and more. This helps in creating consistent and easily understandable API documentation.
