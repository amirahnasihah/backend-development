# Library Management System Project Introduction

In the following tutorials, we will be building a library API using Node.js and Express. This task is designed to help you learn how to manage access to permissioned areas, handle secrets, create roles, and implement authentication and authorization.

The library API will allow users to browse through a collection of books, and also allow them to borrow or return books. To achieve this, we will implement the following features:

- **Authentication**: We will use a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system to authenticate users.
- **Authorization**: We will create roles for users and use middleware to restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user's role.
- **Secret management**: We will store sensitive information like passwords and JWT secrets in environment variables to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Database management**: We will use MySQL as our database to store information about books and users.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Node.js, Express, and MySQL along with familiarity with Sequelize.
