## Authentication and Authorization

1. **Authentication**: process of verifying someone of who they are claiming to be, for example, someone saying that they are “john@doe.com” and want to access the application.

2. **Authorization**: process of verifying if someone has access to an area of the application when their identity is already known to the server and the API checks for the access a user shall have, for example different access between an admin and a user.
